# CodordGround
A Discord Bot for coding Ground
Roughly, this bot is created to train myself to code a discord bot myself, actually not myself, i also learn code and learn guides on other website too, such as [DiscordJs Guide](https://discordjs.guide)
Also, Join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ASHGkue) so it's easy to meet me and ask something, actually im not your teacher so i will not teach you üòÇ

At Wednesday 8 December, i make website for CodeGround, actually sorry for the bad css, i'm bad at choosing style and animation, so it's still in maintenance and probably never going to publish it to global but here if you want
[CodeGround Website](https://codeground.glitch.me)

If you found out a bug, or something that's weird on the code, just open a issue and i will try to solve it as fast as possible, and always i will say thank you for those who help me find out a bug

## üç¥For Forking
Feel free to fork my code, it's free and you can edit with your own style, well i didnt explain well the code what's the section is, what's this used for, so you will need to explore it yourself, you can decide you want to use my credits or no, i dont care just do whatever you want i will try to make new command and code as my free time
